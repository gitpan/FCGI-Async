Revision history for FCGI-Async

0.17    CHANGES:
         * Added 'use warnings'
         * Documentation updates
         * Various small updates to keep CPANTS happy

0.16    BUGFIXES:
         * Support FCGI_GET_VALUES 
           (closes http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43976)
         * Use Test::HexString and wait_for_stream() during testing

0.15    BUGFIXES:
         * Correctly handle webserver-aborted requests - silently discard
           output.

0.14    CHANGES:
         * Reworked constructor to use IO::Async::Loop->listen(). Allows
           specifying a specific hostname.
         * Added Request->stream_stdout_then_finish().
         * Combine small stream writes into larger ones, to gain overhead
           efficiences over the TCP socket.

        BUGFIXES:
         * Respect the FCGI_KEEP_CONN flag to close connections if required

0.13    CHANGES:
         * Updated for IO::Async 0.11:
            + IO::Async::Set is now ::Loop
            + IO::Async::Buffer is now ::Stream
            + Use of $loop->watch_child() in examples rather than hand-coded
              around watching SIGCHLD directly.

0.12    BUGFIXES:
         * Updated to IO::Async::Buffer 0.10 (method/event renames)
